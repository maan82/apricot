<div class="text_head">  Service after Renting</div>
<div  class="text_para">
At Aeon we not only help you through the complex and sometimes stressful process of renting, we also facilitate our services to you afterwards. When we are fully managing a property we deal with any day to day issues raised by yourselves, any repairs to be carried out and any further requirements that you would have over the time, leaving you in a peaceful state of mind. Our after service is one of the reasons that we get a large number of clients through word-of-mouth publicity.
