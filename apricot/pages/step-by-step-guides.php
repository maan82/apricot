Our in-depth local knowledge and experience helps us in achieving the right price across all our clients' properties.</p> 
  <p>Call us on <strong> <?php echo $PHONE; ?> </strong> or complete the property <a  class="blacklink" href="valuation.php">valuation request</a> form.</p> 
  <p><strong>2nd Step: Choosing an Estate Agent</strong></p> 
  <p>When you select an estate agent always keep in mind few factors to help you go through your sales process quickly and effectively. These factors to be considered are their opening hours, availability to carry out viewings, and what kind of marketing would be devised for your property. This basic know how will help you in accomplishing the right kind of exposure and price for your property.</p> 
  <p><strong>3rd Step: Consulting and Instructing a Solicitor</strong></p> 
<p>It is integral to consult a professional and qualified solicitor beforehand to achieve a successful and quick sale of your property. That is why we recommend you to explore before making the final decision in order to avoid a prolonged process.  Even at this step we can help you by our suggestions and references, if needed through our recommended solictors.</p> 
<p><strong>4th Step:  Portraying &amp; Marketing your Property</strong></p> 
<p>Our marketing team will take photographs, prepare floor plans and provide a complete property description during the valuation. Once instructed by you, we will then market your property on our website, local newspapers, other web- based property portals such as Rightmove, Prime Location, Zoopla etc., coloured brochures sent to the existing database via email and post. At Aeon Property Services we ensure maximum exposure of your property through a number of advertising mediums.</p> 
<p><strong>5th Step: Flexible Arrangement for Viewings</strong></p> 
<p>We work 9am – 6.30pm Monday to Friday and 10am – 3.30pm on Saturdays. We arrange special viewings on request even on Sundays. By being available to the buyer we increase the chances for more viewings of your property thereby resulting in quick sales. We also escort during the viewings, a lot of times to make it more convenient for you and extend our expert opinions to the clients. </p> 
<p><strong>6th Step: Getting an Offer</strong></p> 
<p>Followed by viewings when we start getting offers we inform you immediately via telephone and through written communication. We also notify you about any particular conditions (like cash buy, mortgage agreed in principle etc.) and keep a check on the prospective buyer`s ability to continue with sales process to help you decide whether or not to accept the offer.</p> 
<p><strong>7th Step: Offer Accepted</strong></p> 
<p>After receiving an offer acceptance from you we follow the steps below:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>Ask you to confirm your solicitor's details</li> 
  <li>Prepare a memorandum of sale</li> 
  <li>Write to all parties to confirm the settled price<br /> 
  </li> 
</ul> 
<p>
Your solicitor will send out a draft contract and your property's EPC (Energy Performance Certificate) to the buyer's solicitor who will then carry out preliminary enquiries. At this stage you will also be able to agree on dates for the survey on your property, exchange of contracts and proposed date for completion.
	<br /> 
  </p> 
<p>We will advise you and negotiate on your behalf throughout this process, keeping you informed every step of the way. There are no legal obligations until contracts are signed.<br /> 
  <br /> 
  <strong>8th Step : Exchange of Contracts</strong></p> 
<p>Exchange of contracts takes place when the following have been confirmed and agreed:</p> 
<p>Preliminary enquiries following receipt of draft contract</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>Evidence of a good title</li> 
  <li>Specific issues highlighted in the Lease, if applicable</li> 
  <li>Local search queries</li> 
  <li>Fixtures and fittings to be included in the sale</li> 
  <li>The buyer's mortgage offer<br /> 
  </li> 
</ul> 
<p>Once the contract has been signed by both parties the deposit (usually 10% of the purchase price) will be telegraphically transferred or paid in the form of a banker's draft by the buyer's solicitor to your solicitor. The completion date is then set by mutual agreement.<br /> 
  <br /> 
  <strong>9th Step: Completion</strong><br /> 
  </p> 
<p>Completion is when the remaining amount of money (usually 90%) is transferred from the buyer's solicitor to your solicitor's account.</p> 
<p>Your solicitor will inform you when the money has cleared in your account and will notify us to release the keys.</p> 
<p>Congratulations, your property is now sold!</p>

<div class="text_head"><a name="buyingguide" id="buyingguide"></a>Step-by-Step Guide to Buying</div>
<p><strong>1st Step: Organising the Mortgage</strong></p> 
<p>Before the property search, it is suitable to arrange your finances and, in certain situations if required, have a mortgage agreed in principle. This will confirm how much money you will have to fund the purchase.</p> 
<p>Our recommended mortgage broker, has access to the entire market, as well as exclusive deals and rates to help find you the best mortgage available.</p> 
<p><strong>2nd Step: Register yourselves and notify us about your interest</strong><br /> 
  </p> 
<p>The first step is to call us on <strong> <?php echo $PHONE; ?> </strong>   in order to find the right property and register your details so we can get in touch with you to  discuss your property requirements with us. You can also <a  class="blacklink"  href="emailalerts.php">register online</a>.<br /> 
  </p> 
<p><strong>3rd Step: Finding the right property</strong><br /> 
  </p> 
<p>Once we know about your exact requirements we provide you with the details of a number of properties to suit your needs and criteria. We update you continually via emails, SMS alerts when the latest properties become available.</p> 
<p><strong>4th Step: Flexible arrangement for viewings</strong></p> 
<p>We work 9am – 6.30pm Monday to Friday and 10am – 3.30pm on Saturdays. We arrange special viewings on request even on Sundays. By being available to you at flexible hours, we increase the chances for more viewings depending upon your work hours thereby resulting in quick purchase of the property of your choice. We also escort during the viewings, a lot of times to make it more convenient for you and provide any further information you require along with our expert opinions about the property. </p> 
<p><strong>5th Step: Consulting and Instructing a Solicitor</strong></p> 
<p>It is integral to consult a professional and qualified solicitor beforehand to achieve a successful and quick purchase of any property. That is why we recommend you to explore before making the final decision in order to avoid a prolonged process. It is important for the solicitor to know the area you are planning to move to and also is a specialist in conveyancing.  Even at this step we can help you by our suggestions and references, if needed.</p> 
<p><strong>6th Step: Making an offer</strong></p> 
<p>Once you have finalised and made up your mind about a specific property we will put your offer forward to the vendor of the property both verbally and in writing stating any special conditions of the offer. You may need to show, if required, that you are able to continue with the buying process (e.g. provide evidence of your mortgage agreed in principle). </p> 
<p>There are no legal obligations on either side until contracts are signed.</p> 
<p><strong>7th Step: Offer agreed</strong></p> 
<p>Once your offer is accepted we will do the following:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>Ask you to confirm your solicitor's and mortgage broker's details</li> 
  <li>Prepare a memorandum of sale</li> 
  <li>Write to all parties to confirm the settled price<br /> 
  </li> 
</ul> 
<p>You will now need to instruct your solicitor to proceed with the conveyancing process and your mortgage broker to proceed with your application.<br /> 
  </p> 
<p><strong>8th Step: Conveyancing</strong><br /> 
  </p> 
<p>As part of the conveyancing process your solicitor will do the following:<br /> 
  </p> 
<ul> 
  <li>Raise any enquiries on receipt of the draft contract from the seller's solicitor</li> 
  <li>Request their own local searches</li> 
  <li>Refer to the information already provided in the seller's Home Information Pack</li> 
  <li>Agree on a date for exchange of contracts<br /> 
  </li> 
</ul> 
<p>We will assist your solicitor and negotiate throughout the process, keeping you informed every step of the way.<br /> 
  </p> 
<p><strong>9th Step: Survey and Mortgage Offer</strong><br /> 
  </p> 
<p>A survey of the property will be booked by a surveyor on behalf of the mortgage lender to identify any structural problems and advise on the property's value.<br /> 
  After the mortgage valuation report is received, a formal mortgage offer will be sent to you and your solicitor which you will need to sign before it is returned.<br /> 
  There are no legal obligations until contracts are signed.<br /> 
  </p> 
<p><strong>10th Step: Exchange of Contracts</strong><br /> 
  </p> 
<p>Exchange of contracts occurs when all enquiries have been confirmed and agreed.</p> 
<p>Once the contract has been signed by both parties the deposit (usually 10% of the purchase price) will be telegraphically transferred or paid in the form of a banker's draft from your solicitor to the seller's solicitor.</p> 
<p>The completion date is then set by mutual agreement.</p> 
<p><strong>11th Step: Completion</strong></p> 
<p>Completion is when the remaining amount of money (usually 90%) is transferred from the buyer's solicitor to your solicitor's account. We will release the keys once the money has cleared in the seller's account.</p> 
<p>Congratulations, you are now the owner of your property!</p>

<p><strong>1st Step: Accurate Valuation</strong></p> 
<p>Keeping in mind that any landlord aims to let the property at the best possible rental value in the shortest possible time, we aim to carry out a large number of valuations every month which provides us with extensive of knowledge of property values in your area. Our in-depth local knowledge and experience helps us in achieving the right rental value across all our clients' properties.</p>

<p>When you select an estate agent always keep in mind few factors to help you go through your process of letting quickly and effectively. These factors to be considered are their opening hours, availability to carry out viewings, and what kind of marketing would be devised for your property. This basic know how will help you in accomplishing the right kind of exposure and rental value for your property.</p> 
<p>The other facts that need to be checked are whether the compulsory required Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) (as per the new legislation) would be arranged by them on your behalf or you need to arrange this yourself? Aeon property services can arrange this for you. You are responsible for making this document available to prospective and future tenants.</p> 
<p><strong>3rd Step: A fully managed property - complete peace of mind</strong></p> 
<p>At Aeon Estates we not only help you through the complex and sometimes stressful process of letting out, we also facilitate our services to you afterwards.

<p>At first it is important to make your property presentable so please consider handling any refurbishments that you had been planning to do. Small DIY jobs here and there, any tidying up or fixing the clutter will present the excellent features of your property and at  time will make it  more presentable. </p>

	</p> 
<p><strong>5th Step: Preparing your Property for Tenancy</strong></p> 
<p>Before you let your property for the first time you must obtain a professional and comprehensive inventory. This will set out the condition and contents of the property. Aeon Estates will carry out a professional inventory on your behalf.</p>
